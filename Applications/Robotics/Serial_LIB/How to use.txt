    When upgrading from V3 or V4 Beta x to V4, it is essential that you remove the old V3 Comm API files ('comm.jar', 'win32com.dll' and 'javax.comm.properties') from the Java VM that will be used by jLog.
    Please download 'RXTXcomm.jar' and install it in the 'lib/ext' folder of the Java VM (e.g. for Sun's Java 1.6.0_04 it will typically be 'C:\Program Files\Java\j2re1.6.0_04\lib\ext'). 
    Please download 'rxtxSerial.dll' and install it in the 'bin' folder of the Java VM (e.g. for Sun's Java 1.6.0_04 it will be 'C:\Program Files\Java\j2re1.6.0_04\bin').
